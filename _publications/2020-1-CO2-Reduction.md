## Abstract
Nowadays, photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> represents a very promising solution for storing solar energy in value-added chemicals, but so far it has been hampered by the lack of highly efficient catalyst of photocathode. Enlightened by the Calvin cycle of plants, here we show that a series of three-dimensional C/N-doped heterojunctions of Zn<sub>x</sub>:Co<sub>y</sub>@Cu are successfully fabricated and applied as photocathodes in the PEC reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to generate paraffin product. These materials integrate semiconductors of p-type Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and n-type ZnO on Cu foam to construct fine heterojunctions with multiple active sites, which result in excellent C-C coupling control in reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. The best catalyst of Zn<sub>0.2</sub>:Co<sub>1</sub>@Cu yields paraffin at a rate of 325 ug h<sup>-1</sup> under 0.4V versus saturated calomel electrode without H<sub>2</sub> release. The apparent quantum efficiency of PEC cell is up to 1.95%.
