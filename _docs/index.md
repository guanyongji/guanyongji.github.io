### 11 July 2020
Two in a roll! Congratulations to Purit Phan-udom, Naruedon Wattanakul, Tattiya Sakulniwat for getting their senior project work titled ‚ÄúTeddy: Automatic Recommendation of Pythonic Idiom Usage for Pull-Based Software Projects‚Äù published as a tool demonstration paper at the 36th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME). 

The work published is an automated tool, called Teddy, that promotes the usage of Pythonic idioms. The tool offers a prevention mode with Just-In-Time analysis to recommend the use of Pythonic idiom during code review and a detection mode with historical analysis to run a thorough scan of idiomatic and non-idiomatic code. More info can be found at the study website [https://muict-seru.github.io/icsme20-teddy-tooldemo/](https://muict-seru.github.io/icsme20-teddy-tooldemo/).
